## ✨ My design concept

- Visual presentation: Attach pictures and sample results to facilitate understanding and presentation of results
- Focus on goal orientation: Each prompt has a clear goal and output expectation
- Step-by-step optimization: using techniques like `Chain of Thought`, `Few-shot`, `System Prompt`, etc.
