# Business: HR & Recruitment Prompts

This section contains AI prompt frameworks designed for HR professionals and recruiters.  
The prompts assist in creating job descriptions, screening resumes, generating interview questions, and summarizing candidate profiles. Each prompt can be customized to fit any position.

## 1. **Job Description Generator Prompt**  
> Generate clear and comprehensive job descriptions tailored to the role and requirements.  

### **Prompt:**

The ideal candidate should have [Experience] of experience in [Role Title] with expertise in [Skills]. Preferred qualifications include [Preferred Qualifications]. Ensure the job description includes key responsibilities and qualifications for the position.

> **Techniques Used:**
> - **Chain of Thought**: The prompt logically leads the AI to generate all necessary sections (job title, responsibilities, qualifications) based on input criteria.
> - **Few-shot**: The example of a "Product Manager" role gives the AI context for how to format the output.
> - **System Prompt**: The AI is instructed to generate specific parts of the job description (Responsibilities and Qualifications) while incorporating the user input.

## 2. **Resume Analyzer**

> **Note:** This analysis is informational only. Final evaluation and hiring decisions must be made by HR personnel.

> - **System Prompting**: Ensures the AI outputs strictly within the defined informational categories to maintain neutrality and compliance.

## Compliance Note  
This Resume Analyzer is designed to comply with global AI regulations, including the EU AI Act and the U.S. EEOC's initiatives on AI fairness in employment, by avoiding automated decision-making and ensuring human oversight.  
Final hiring decisions must always be made by human HR personnel.
